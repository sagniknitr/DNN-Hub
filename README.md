# DNN-Hub
Understanding and experimenting with Neural networks for computer vision based advanced driving systems and multimedia solutions.

Below are the plans for this repo : 

- [X] Complete Stanford CS231n course
- [X] More details on back propagation.
- [ ] Complete Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.
- [X] Understand mobilenet and Inception V3.
- [ ] Efficient Neural network architectures on hardware.(GPU/DSP)
- [x] Optical Flow solutions
- [ ] Hourglass network for human pose estimation.



# Notes

I have written down important [concepts](./Notes/) related to applied Deep Learning and Computer Vision in various Multimedia and ADAS applications
