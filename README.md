# DNN-Hub
Understanding and experimenting with Neural networks for computer vision based advanced driving systems.

Below are the plans for this repo : 

- [ ] Complete CS231n course
- [ ] More details on back propagation.
- [ ] Understand mobilenet and segnet.
- [ ] Efficient Neuran network architecture on hardware.(GPU/DSP)
